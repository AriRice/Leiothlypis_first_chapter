# Leiothlypis_first_chapter
Contains everything from the previous 3 Leiothlypis repositories... but better. 

How to do everything:
1. Run Step 1 interactively. Follow ALL the directions. 

2. Run the alignment script (step 2) from the 08_align_script folder.

3. Run step 3 interactively from the 08_align_script folder. 

4a. Run the Step_04a script from the main working directory. Requires a popmap.txt file in the 01_bam_files folder. Make that first. 

4b. Move the *depth.txt files and the leiothlypis_coverage.txt file into the 01_coverage folder, copy this folder to an external HD, and run Step_04b_plot_coverage.r in R on the big desktop computer.
