# Leiothlypis_first_chapter
Contains everything from the previous 3 Leiothlypis repositories... but better. 

How to do everything:
1) Run Step 1 interactively. Follow ALL the directions. 

2) Run the alignment script (step 2) from the 08_align_script folder.

3) Run step 3 interactively from the 08_align_script folder. 

4) Run the Step_04a script from the main working directory. Requires a popmap.txt file in the 01_bam_files folder. Make that first.
