# Make directories for the analyses
mkdir 00_fastq

# Now transfer your raw data files for this project to 00_fastq with scp OR just drag and drop w/ filezilla. 
# Might take a bit because these are very big files.

#### This'll include ###########
# 1) all the original raw Leiothlypis reads save for M2, M10, and M16 (because these ones failed/ were contaminated)
# 2) Jack's raw reads for Geothlypis poliocephala (5 samples, 1 forward read and 1 reverse read for each)
# 3) ruficapilla and peregrina redos (N16-N21). Each sample has 4 files, so list them in a redos.txt file, concat them w/ the following, 
# and put the originals somewhere else for safekeeping:
while read -r redos; do
	cat ${redos}_*R1_* >> ./${redos}_R1.fastq.gz
	cat ${redos}_*R2_* >> ./${redos}_R2.fastq.gz
done < redos.txt

# Next, make a "rename" folder in 00_fastq, and add a rename_samples.txt file to it w/old names in the left column and the new names in the right. 
# Copy the fastq files into it and run the following command:

while read -r name1 name2; do mv $name1 $name2
done < rename_samples.txt


# If it worked, move the files one folder up, delete the rename folder, and delete the original fastq files 
# (assuming they are safely & permanently stored somewhere else). 

# Move back to your main directory. 

# Make a basenames.txt file and put it there. 

# Now put the Yellowthroat reference genome in the 00_ref_genome folder.
