## Get an interactive session with at least 4 cores. 

## DELETE tree files associated with the W chromosome, BUT NOT THE Z!!! 
rm windows/RAxML_bipartitions.CM019934*.tre
rm windows/RAxML_bootstrap.CM019934*.tre 

## Make a new folder in phylostats called "final_tree_products"

cat windows/RAxML_bipartitions.CM0199* >> final_tree_products/Leiothlypis_50kbp.trees
## This might take a few minutes. 
### For making a densitree plot, you might also want to run dendropy on Leiothlypis_50kbp.trees to collapse branches that have less than 50% bootstrap support. 
### FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT!!!!!!

## maximum clade credibility tree (simple summarization) from all gene trees using dendropy:
## gives info about which nodes have support from what proportion of gene trees
cd final_tree_products/
conda activate dendropy
sumtrees.py --output=leiothlypis_50kbp.tre --min-clade-freq=0.05 Leiothlypis_50kbp.trees 

## coalescent tree of all gene trees using ASTRAL III
## automatically calculates local branch support using quartets, described here: https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw079
java -jar /lustre/work/arrice/Astral/astral.5.7.8.jar -i Leiothlypis_50kbp.trees -o leiothlypis_50kbp_astral.tre 2> leiothlypis_50kbp_astral.log
## this will also take a few minutes.
