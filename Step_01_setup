# Now transfer your raw data files for this project to the directory 00_fastq

#### This includes all the original raw Leiothlypis reads save for M2, M10, and M16 (because these ones failed/ were contaminated)
#### Also include the Geothlypis raw reads (5 samples, 1 forward read and 1 reverse read for each)
#### Also include ruficapilla and peregrina redos (N16-N21, which is 6 samples. 1 forward read and 1 reverse read each). 

# Use the cp command and not mv because you don't want to delete the files from their original locations. Or just drag + drop with filezilla. 
# This might take a few minutes because these are very big files. 
# You can check filezilla or open another terminal window to see the files being copied. 

cd 00_fastq
mkdir rename
cp M* rename
cd rename

# Now you'll tweak the names a bit. Just to make them more informative.
# Create a rename_samples.txt with the old names in the left column and the new names in the right. Then run the following command:

while read -r name1 name2; do mv $name1 $name2
done < rename_samples.txt

# If it worked, move the files, delete the folder, and delete the original ones. 
mv * ..
cd ..
rm -r rename
rm *L004*

# Move back to your main directory. 
# make a basenames.txt file and put it there.
